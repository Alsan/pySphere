pySphere
========
VMware vSphere Web Service client in Python.


Preface
-------
* This is a enhanced fork of Sebastian Tello's [PySphere](https://code.google.com/p/pysphere/), not just a git-svn mirror.
* All trademarks and registered trademarks are the property of their respective owners.
* Pull requests are welcome.


Features
--------
* Connect to VMWare's ESX, ESXi, Virtual Center, Virtual Server hosts
* Query hosts, datacenters, datastores, resource pools, virtual machines
* VMs: Power on, power off, reset, revert to snapshot, get properties, update vmware tools, clone, migrate
* vSphere 5.0 Guest operations: Create/delete/move files and directories. Upload/download files and directories from the guest system. List/start/stop processes in the guest system
* Create and delete snapshots
* Create and download screenshots of guest display
* vSphere 5.0 Datastore operations: Upload/download files from the datastore file system
* Get hosts statistics and monitor performance

And of course, you can use it to access all the vSphere API through python.

It's built upon a slightly modified version of [ZSI](http://pywebsvcs.sourceforge.net/zsi.html) (that comes bundled-in) which makes it really fast in contrast to other python SOAP libraries that don't
provide code generation.


Installation
------------
The “pysphere” package in PyPI is the original version (Sebastian's). Currently the only way to install this package is to download this repository and run `python setup.py install`.


Quick Example
-------------
Here's an example of how to query and power on all virtual machines in the specified datacenter and cluster.

```python
from pysphere import VIServer
server = VIServer()
server.connect("my.esx.host.example.com", "username", "secret")
vms = server.get_registered_vms(datacenter="MyDataCenter", cluster="MyCluster")
for vm_path in vms:
    print "vm_path = [%s]" % vm_path # "[datastore] path/to/file.vmx"
    vm = server.get_vm_by_path(vm_path)
    vm.power_on()
    print vm.get_status() # "POWERED ON"
```
